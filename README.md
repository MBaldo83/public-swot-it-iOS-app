# Public-Swot-It-iOS-App

An app that uses an AI powered backend to generate flashcards on any topic.

I'm primarily using this as a practical 'not too big, not too small' project with which to try out AI assisted coding which I publish about on my blog here: https://www.doubledotdevelopment.co.uk. But who knows, maybe one day this will be a real product!

## How to Run
You should be able to download and run the app in XCode, and feel free to explore the code. Unfortunatley the back-end isn't something I've got into a good state to run at the moment, so you'll need to do a lot of work to get the app to actually do anything other than display errors, sorry!
