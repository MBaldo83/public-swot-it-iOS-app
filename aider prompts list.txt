Write a Mock of RequestBuilding that implements the protocol, allows for custom responses, and saves the arguments provided to the last method invocation. Add the mock to NetworkingTestsMocks.swift

Write unit tests for RequestBuilderDecodingEndpointNetwork using MockRequestBuilder that creates an instance of RequestBuilderDecodingEndpointNetwork as a variable named `sut`, and mocks the injected dependencies and tests the logic of the entity. Use JSONDecodingNetworkLayerTests as an example when writing the tests. Add a new file into the folder Swot_It/SwotItTests/NetworkingTests

Write unit tests for IdentityModifier using MockIdentity that creates an instance of IdentityModifier as a variable named `sut`, and mocks the injected dependencies and tests the logic of the entity. Use JSONDecodingNetworkLayerTests as an example when writing the tests.
