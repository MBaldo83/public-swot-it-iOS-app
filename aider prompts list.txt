--- Scripting Against Aider 

1. save config: 
 - add files: how-to-create new view, data required for view (LocalDeck + QuestionSubmission)
2. start and run prompt to make new view, saving data variables in desired way
3. save config: 
 - add files: just-created new view, all data (LocalDeck + QuestionSubmission), navigation files
 - make unique chat history
 - load chat history - true
4. start and run prompt to add navigation route with data requirements
5. start and run prompt to implement switch "func view(for route: Router.Route) -> some View"
6. save config:
 - add files: navigate from view DeckReviewView
7. start and run prompt to navigate to new view
8. 




--- Prompts to navigate to a new view

Elements required to make the view and navigate:

-----

Feature Requirements DeckReviewView:

* View Interactions
 - SubmitResults
 - Back

* Navigation
 - SubmitResults(Forward(DeckReviewResultsView))

 -----

Feature Requirements DeckResultsView:

* ViewLayout
  - Header("Congratulatory Message")
  - SubHeader(LocalDeck topic)
  - Chart(QuestionSubmission)
  - Button(Continue)

* View Data Requirements 
  - PresentedStates: [
    ReadOnly(LocalDeck),
    ReadOnly(QuestionSubmission)
  ]
  - ExternalModifiersOfState: []

* View Interactions
 - Continue
 - Back

 * Navigation
 - Continue(Back(DeckReviewResultsView))
 - Back(Back())

View-Feature Architecture:
* A view is a SwiftUI View
- PresentedState
 - ReadOnly, ReadWrite
- ExternalModifiersOfState
 - [ViewNames] 
- ViewSideEffectRequirements
 - AsyncPresentedState
 - AsyncOtherModel(ModelDomain)

ModelDomain:
- Identity

--- Unit Test Prompts

Entities to test:
JSONDecodingNetworkLayer
HeadersModifier
IdentityModifier
RequestBuilder
RequestBuilderDecodingEndpointNetwork

Write a Mock of RequestBuilding that implements the protocol, allows for custom responses, and saves the arguments provided to the last method invocation. Add the mock to NetworkingTestsMocks.swift

Write unit tests for RequestBuilderDecodingEndpointNetwork using MockRequestBuilder that creates an instance of RequestBuilderDecodingEndpointNetwork as a variable named `sut`, and mocks the injected dependencies and tests the logic of the entity. Use JSONDecodingNetworkLayerTests as an example when writing the tests. Add a new file into the folder Swot_It/SwotItTests/NetworkingTests

Write unit tests for IdentityModifier using MockIdentity that creates an instance of IdentityModifier as a variable named `sut`, and mocks the injected dependencies and tests the logic of the entity. Use JSONDecodingNetworkLayerTests as an example when writing the tests.
